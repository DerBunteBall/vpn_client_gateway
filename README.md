<h1>Pi-Powered VPN Client Gateway</h1>
The VPN Client Gateway forwards network traffic through a Virtual Private Network connection. To facilitate geospoofing for media streaming, it includes a management web page that allows you to switch VPN servers by simply clicking on a country flag.

To build your own VPN Client Gateway you will need a Raspberry Pi (or similar lightweight Linux computer) and a Private Internet Access account.

A detailed installation guide for setting up the VPN Client Gateway on a Raspberry Pi is included.

Here is a screenshot showing the management web page:
