Please avoid surprise pull requests!
Any changes that affect the interface (management web page), schema (i.e. vpnservers.xml), server application behaviour, or overall functionality should be discussed prior to starting any coding efforts.
To initiate such a discussion please do one of the following:
	- comment on an existing open issue
	- create a new issue if one does not exist that covers the proposed change (if the issue is to address an enhancement, the issue should be labeled with 'enhancement' when you submit it)
	- email the repository owner

Thank you.
