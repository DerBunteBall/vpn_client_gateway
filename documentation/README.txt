All documentation, including the installation guide, can now be found in the project wiki:
https://github.com/mr-canoehead/vpn_client_gateway/wiki

I have removed the PDF version of the installation guide in order to eliminate duplication and to reduce maintenance overhead.
If you feel that there is value in having a PDF version of the installation guide (e.g. for printing out hardcopies), let me know and I'll consider adding it back to the project.
